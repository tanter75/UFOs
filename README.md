# Challenge #11 – UFO Sightings 

## Overview of Project 

### 

The purpose of this project is to create a HTML site and dynamic table that will allow its users to look up UFO sightings based on single, multiple or no criteria entered. 

 

## Results 

### 

The website offers a functional, interactive data table that allows users to look up UFO sightings using filters for date, city, state, country and shape.  The information in the data base is limited mainly to the United States and only for January 2010.  As such it is difficult to get an in-depth understanding of any patterns that may occur over months or years, or the frequency that sightings occur.  As the information is mainly centered in the US, the site is not able to provide information for those seeking information on sightings in other parts of the world. 

## Summary 

### 

The website and code used provides a good start to UFO enthusiasts looking to gain additional information about UFO sightings.  One of the drawbacks of the site is its limited searchable data. 

It is recommended that the data set be increased to include the following: 

        -     Global sightings 

Increased historically data (e.g. 10 years)  

It is also recommended that the site allow users to save their own custom searches results, as well as host a forum where users can post their search results and observations.  This would increase the functionality of the site as well as the perspective audience.  If the recommendations are adopted into the site users will be better able to compile and communicate historical sighting trends with regards to location, duration shape and frequency.  This will undoubtedly increase traffic to Dana’s website.
